This app was created to demonstrate my understanding of connecting a PostgreSQL database to a full-functioning web application. 

The criteria you will need to run this application locally: 
1. PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
2. A code editor

Steps to running locally: 
1. Make sure PostgresSQL and PgAmin are downloaded to your computer
   
    - If they are not, use the below links to  begin the download:
      > Mac - https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1258653 
        - Mac Users: If a pop-up asks permission to run the installer, select Open. You might need to enter your Mac password to allow the installer to run.
      > Windows - https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1258649
        - Windows Users: If prompted to run the installer, select YES.
    - Click 'Next' until you see the screen that asks you to check all the packages you want installed.
      > For Mac and Windows users, you want to make sure all boxes are checked
        - PostgreSQL Server
        - pgAdmin
        - Stack Builder
        - Command Line Tools
    - Keep clicking on the 'Next' button until you come across a prompt asking you to enter a username and password.
      > The username will be 'postgres' and you will need to create a password. It is EXTREMELY important to write this password down for later use.
    - Continue until you click 'Finish'
    - A prompt for Stack Builder may appear after installation, but you can close it.
    
2. Once PostgreSQL is successfully installed, you will need to build out your database.
    - To begin, launch pgAdmin. Once pgAdmin is open, navigate to the PostgreSQL server.
      > Here you will be prompted to enter the password you created earlier.
